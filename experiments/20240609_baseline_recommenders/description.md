The experiment.ipynb Jupyter notebook is part of a movie recommendation system project. It tests several recommendation algorithms, including random recommendations, popularity-based recommendations, rating-based recommendations, weighted random recommendations, and non-biased rating recommendations.

Each recommendation algorithm is tested on a temporal split of movie ratings. The top k recommendations for each user are stored in corresponding dictionaries (random_recommendations_k, popularity_recommendations_k, etc.).

The performance of these recommendation algorithms is evaluated using several metrics, including Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K, MAP@K, MRR, Hit Rate@K, and Coverage@K.

The total_amount_of_movies variable likely represents the total number of movies in the dataset or considered in this experiment.

Users of this notebook can expect to interact with these recommendation algorithms and their performance metrics, possibly adjusting the algorithms or the value of k to see how these changes affect the performance of the recommendation system."
